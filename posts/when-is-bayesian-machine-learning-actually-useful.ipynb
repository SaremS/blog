    "\n",
    "When it comes to Bayesian Machine Learning, you likely either love it or prefer to stay at a safe distance from anything Bayesian. Given that current state-of-the-art models hardly ever mention Bayes at all, there is probably at least some rationale behind the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, many high profile research groups are have been working on Bayesian Machine Learning tools for decades. And they still do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is rather unlikely that this field is complete quackery either. As often in life, the truth lies probably somewhere between the two extremes. In this article, I want to share my view on the titled question and point out when Bayesian Machine Learning can be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion, let us briefly define what Bayesian Machine Learning means in the context of this article:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"The Bayesian framework for machine learning states that you start out by enumerating all reasonable models of the data and assigning your prior belief P(M) to each of these models. Then, upon observing the data D, you evaluate how probable the data was under each of these models to compute P(D|M).\"* - [**Zoubin Ghahramani**](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html?ref=sarem-seitz.com#:~:text=The%20Bayesian%20framework%20for%20machine,P(D%7CM).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Less formally, we apply tools and frameworks from [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics?ref=sarem-seitz.com) to Machine Learning models. I will provide some references at the end, in case you are not familiar with Bayesian statistics yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, our discussion will essentially equate Machine Learning with neural networks and differentiable models in general (particularly Linear Regression). Since Deep Learning is currently the cornerstone of modern Machine Learning, this appears to be a fair approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final disclaimer, we will differentiate between frequentist and Bayesian Machine Learning. The former includes the standard ML methods and loss functions that you are probably already familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the fact that 'Bayesian' is written in uppercase but 'frequentist' is not has no judgemental meaning.\n",

The easiest solution to this issue is the application of the [reparameterization trick](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/04/29/reparameterization/?ref=sarem-seitz.com).

    "$$\n",
    "There is a clear tradeoff between the size of the dataset, $N$, and the amount of model parameters, $K$. For sufficiently large datasets, the prior on the right side becomes irrelevant for the MAP solution and vice-versa. This is also a key property for posterior inference in general.\n",

    "When the dataset is small in relation to the amount of model parameters, the posterior distribution will closely resemble the prior. Thus, if the prior distribution contains sensible information about the problem, we can mitigate the lack of data to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example a plain linear regression model. Depending on the signal-to-noise ratio, a lot of data might be necessary before the parameters converge to the 'best' value. If you have a well reasoned prior distribution about that 'best' solution, your model might actually converge faster.\n",

    "Also, even if you don't want to go fully Bayesian, a MAP estimate could still be useful given high-quality prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional priors for modern Bayesian Machine Learning\n",
    "A different issue might be the difficulty of expressing meaningful prior knowledge over neural network weights. If the model is a black-box, how could you actually tell it what to do? Apart from maybe some vague zero-mean Normal distribution over weights?\n",
    "\n",
    "One promising direction to solve this issue could be [functional Bayes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05779.pdf?ref=sarem-seitz.com). In that approach, we only tell the network what outputs we expect for given inputs, based on our prior knowledge. Hence, we only care about the posterior functions that our model can express. The exact parameter posterior distribution is only of secondary interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, if you have only limited data but well-informed prior knowledge, Bayesian Machine Learning could actually help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of uncertainty quantification\n",
    "For large datasets, the effect of your prior knowledge becomes less and less relevant. In that case, obtaining a frequentist solution might be fully sufficient and the superior approach. At some occasions however, the full picture - a.k.a. posterior uncertainty - could be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of making a medical decision based on some Machine Learning model. In addition, the model does not produce a final decision but rather supports doctors in their judgement. If Bayesian point accuracy is at least close to a frequentist equivalent, uncertainty output can serve as useful extra information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presuming that the expert's time is limited, they might want to take a closer look at highly uncertain model output. For output with low uncertainty, a quick sanity check might suffice. This of course requires the uncertainty estimates to be valid in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the Bayesian approach comes at the additional cost of monitoring uncertainty performance as well. This should of course be taken into account when deciding whether to use a Bayesian model or not.\n",

    "## Bayesian Deep Learning light with MC dropout\n",
    "Luckily, it is nowadays not too costly to train a Bayesian model. Unless you are working with very big models, the increased computational demand of Bayesian inference should not be too problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particularly straightforward approach to Bayesian inference is MC dropout. The latter was introduced by [Gal and Ghahramani](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gal16.pdf?ref=sarem-seitz.com) and has since become a fairly popular tool. In summary, the authors show that it is sensible to use Dropout during both training and inference of a model. In fact, this is proved to be equivalent to variational inference with a particular, Bernoulli-based, variational distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, MC Dropout can be a great starting point to make your Neural Network Bayes-ish without requiring too much effort upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and cons\n",
    "On the one hand, MC dropout makes it quite straightforward to make an existing model Bayesian. You can simply re-train it with dropout and leave dropout turned on during inference. The samples you create that way can be seen as draws from the Bayesian posterior predictive distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the variational distribution in MC dropout is based on Bernoulli random variables. This should - in theory - make it an even less accurate approximation than the common Gaussian variational distribution. However, building and using a this model is quite simple, requiring only plain Tensorflow or Pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there has been some deeper criticism about the validity of the approach. There exists an interesting debate involving one of the authors [here](https://twitter.com/ianosband/status/1014466510885216256?ref=sarem-seitz.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever you make out of that criticism, MC Dropout can be a helpful baseline for more sophisticated methods. Once you get a hang of Bayesian Machine Learning, you can try to improve performance with more sophisticated model from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "I hope that this article has given you some insights on the usefulness of Bayesian Machine Learning. Certainly, it is no magic bullet and there are many occasions where it might not be the right choice. If you carefully weigh in the pros and cons though, Bayesian methods can be a highly useful tool.\n",
